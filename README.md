# Face Mask Detection using CNN

This project demonstrates how to build a face mask detection system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Python.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a model that can accurately detect whether a person in an image is wearing a face mask or not. This is achieved by training a CNN on a dataset of images of people with and without masks. The trained model can then be used to classify new images and predict whether a person is wearing a mask.

## Dataset

The project uses the "Face Mask Dataset" available on Kaggle. This dataset contains images of people wearing and not wearing face masks. It is used to train and evaluate the CNN model. You can download it using the Kaggle API.
